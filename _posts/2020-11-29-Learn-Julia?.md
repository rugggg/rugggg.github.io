Once again, a shiny new object in the programming/engineering/data science world has caught my eye. This time it's Julia language. A co-worker introduced it to me as a counter to their woes with the dynamic type system of python. At first I thought, nah, python great! Who needs anything else other than the good old snek lang. But of course, the fates floated Julia lang in front of me again and again until I caved and began the often exciting, sometimes frustrating, and always entertaining process of learning a new programming language and paradigm. Julia has loads of interesting features like multiple dispatch (meaning not just overloaded function calls, but identical function signatures with differing types where Julia is smart enough to pick the right one, wicked cool!) but strong typing, speed, gpu integration, and a thriving community of contributors, libraries, and scientific computing libraries. There is a whole lot of promise in this, so I'm playing catch up to learn, and hopefully contribute back! Starting with the MIT Computational Thinking series available for free on YouTube, check the Julia Lang channel.
