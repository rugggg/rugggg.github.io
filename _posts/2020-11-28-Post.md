Just starting up a blog again. It's been quite a while since Rug's Gone Walkabout, and I've missed writing, helps my sanity and clarity. No idea what this will be about really. Ramblings, musing, and some assorted nonsense probably. For now, just publishing this to get started. True story, inspiration for starting this blog courtesy of Taylor Swift and her documentary on her Folklore album. So there's that. Here's to creative pursuits, sanity, and thoughts.
